# passJenS

A simple password generator made in JavaScript. I'm now learning jQuery so I may use it!

## Tasks

- [ ] Use jQuery
- [ ] Add extra chars to be possible to use on the password
- [ ] Not include chars
- [ ] Don't repeat chars
- [ ] Button any char (probably will just activate all input checkboxes or will actually use any chars)
- [ ] passphrase integration

## Why?

I'm in school learning JavaScript. It's a way to study kinda.
